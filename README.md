#KPMG Virtual Data Analytics Internship Experience: Forage
Introduction: Sprocket Central PLC, a medium-sized bike and cycling accessories organization, has approached a partner in KPMG’s Lighthouse & Innovation Team. Sprocket Central PLC is keen to learn more about KPMG’s expertise in its Analytics, Information, and Modeling team.

Primarily, Sprocket Central Pty Ltd. needs help with its customer and transaction data. The organization has a large dataset relating to its customers, but its team is unsure how to analyze it to help optimize its marketing strategy effectively.

The client provided KPMG with 3 datasets:

1.      Customer Demographics:

2.     Customer Addresses

3.    Transaction data in the past 3 months

Note: - Customer Demographic has 15 columns, Customer Address has 6 columns, and Transaction Dataset has 15 columns.

Task: - Sprocket Central Pty Ltd. has given us a new list of 1000 potential customers with their demographics and attributes. However, these customers do not have a prior transaction history with the organization.

The marketing team at Sprocket Central Pty Ltd is sure that, if correctly analyzed, the data would reveal useful customer insights that could help optimize resource allocation for targeted marketing. Hence, improve performance by focusing on high-value customers.

Data Exploration:

The client is happy with the analysis plan and wants us to proceed. After building the model, we must present our results to the client.

Visualizations such as interactive dashboards often help us highlight key findings and convey our ideas more succinctly. The client will not be satisfied with a list of clients or an algorithm, so we must use visualizations to back up our findings.

Task: -

Develop a dashboard that we can present to the client at our next meeting. Display your data summary and results of the analysis in a dashboard (see tools/references for assistance).
